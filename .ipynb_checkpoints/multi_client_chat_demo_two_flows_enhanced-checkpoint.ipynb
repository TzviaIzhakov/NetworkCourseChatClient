    "This notebook demonstrates how to simulate **application-layer traffic** over TCP using Python and sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic multi-client chat demo** â€“ several clients connect to a chat server, send messages, and receive broadcasts.\n",
    "2. **Extended two-flow demo (Chat + VoIP)** â€“ two clients use **two separate TCP connections**:\n",
    "   - Chat flow on port **9001**\n",
    "   - VoIP flow on port **9002**\n",
    "   A relay server simply forwards TCP payloads between clients, allowing you to analyze both flows in Wireshark.\n",

    "## 3. Capturing and Analyzing the Two TCP Flows in Wireshark\n",
    "\n",
    "This final section explains how to use **Wireshark** to capture the Chat and VoIP flows generated by this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Where the traffic runs\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Python code uses `HOST = 127.0.0.1`, so all traffic is on the **loopback** interface.\n",
    "- Two TCP ports are used:\n",
    "  - **9001** for Chat (`flow = CHAT` in the CSV)\n",
    "  - **9002** for VoIP (`flow = VOIP` in the CSV)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Running the demo for capture\n",
    "\n",
    "For best results, run this demo as a standalone script (outside Jupyter):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Export the extended code from this notebook into a file, e.g. `two_flow_demo.py`.\n",
    "2. In a terminal, run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python two_flow_demo.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. While the script is running and exchanging messages, start Wireshark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. Selecting the correct interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In Wireshark:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On **Linux**, choose the `lo` (loopback) interface.\n",
    "- On **macOS**, choose `lo0`.\n",
    "- On **Windows**, choose the `Npcap Loopback Adapter` (or similarly named interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the capture on that interface before or just after you start the Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4. Filter to only Chat + VoIP traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Wireshark filter bar, enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "tcp.port == 9001 || tcp.port == 9002\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This hides all other traffic and shows only the two flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Packets on port **9001** are Chat messages from `chat_messages.csv`.\n",
    "- Packets on port **9002** are VoIP-like messages from `voip_messages.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5. Viewing application payloads\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the application payload for one flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Right-click any packet with `tcp.port == 9001` (Chat).\n",
    "2. Choose **Follow â†’ TCP Stream**.\n",
    "3. A new window shows the Chat payload, including the `timestamp | speaker | flow | message` format you sent from the CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the same steps on a `tcp.port == 9002` packet to inspect the VoIP payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chat flow has **fewer, larger messages** (one per line from the CSV).\n",
    "- VoIP flow has **many small chunks**, because `client2_voip_from_csv` fragments each message into 10-byte segments with short delays.\n",
    "  This makes the VoIP stream look more like packetized media.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6. Optional: Coloring rules for clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "To visually separate the flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **View â†’ Coloring Rules...** in Wireshark.\n",
    "2. Add rules such as:\n",
    "   - Name: `Chat TCP` â€” Filter: `tcp.port == 9001`\n",
    "   - Name: `VoIP TCP` â€” Filter: `tcp.port == 9002`\n",
    "3. Assign different colors so Chat and VoIP packets are easy to distinguish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7. Linking packets back to the CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the application payload embeds the CSV fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `timestamp | speaker | flow | message`\n",
    "\n",
    "students can correlate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **row** in `chat_messages.csv` / `voip_messages.csv`\n",
    "- The **log lines** printed by the notebook\n",
    "- The **actual TCP segments** they see in Wireshark.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides an end-to-end view from application-level logs, through TCP segments, all the way to packet-level capture."
